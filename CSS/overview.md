# CSS
CSS is a key part of the daily work of a frontend developer at P'unk Avenue.
In the past, we have spent quite a bit of time laboring over the CSS in our projects, and these articles represent some of the conclusions that we've reached.

## LESS
At P'unk Ave, we use [LESS]('http://lesscss.org/') to preprocess our stylesheets.
This allows us to easily store values in variables and keep re-usable or computable code in mixins.
While LESS allows these conveniences, it also affords some anti-patters that we'll take the time to address throughout these articles.
