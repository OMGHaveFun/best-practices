[1.1](#workflow) Gitflow

We use [gitflow workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), a branching model designed around project releases. Each repository should have two historical branches, `master` and `develop`.

`origin/master` is the "production-ready" state of the application. `origin/develop` is stable code ready for a release that runs in parallel with `master`.

When working off of the `develop` branch use `feature` branches descriptively named and prefixed by "feature". For example, `feature/new-oauth2-scopes`. When your feature is complete and ready for review you need to make a pull request to merge your code into `develop`. Your code should be passing all tests if applicable. If the code is front-end heavy the UI should be passing in all supported browsers and devices and there should be a link to the UI documented in the pull request. Your code must be reviewed and approved by another member of the team.

When ready to make a release to production you should use a `release` branch off of `develop`, prefixed by "release". For example, `release/1.0.0`. Your release branch should be named using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) and this version should be the same as your version number in `package.json`. A pull request should be made to merge your release into `master`.

If you need to make a bug fix to a production application make a `hotfix` branch off of `master`. A pull request should be made directly into `master` and `master` should then me merged back into `develop` to stay up to date. The developer should follow this branching model when the project is in "post-launch support". If a significant feature is being addressed use `feature` branches off of develop; if bug fixes are being addressed use `hotfix` branches and merge directly into `master`.
